# üè† House Price Prediction

## üìå Project Overview & Task Objective

This notebook aims to predict the sale prices of houses in Ames, Iowa, using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a regression model that accurately estimates house prices based on various features such as area, location, and year built.

## üìÇ Dataset Information

The project utilizes a dataset containing detailed information about residential properties in Ames, Iowa. This typically includes `train.csv` and `test.csv` files with features describing aspects of each house, such as `GrLivArea` (above grade living area), `OverallQual` (overall material and finish quality), `GarageCars` (size of garage in car capacity), `TotalBsmtSF` (total basement square feet), and many more. The target variable is `SalePrice`.

**Key Aspects:**
- Over 80 features describing various aspects of residential homes.
- Includes both numerical and categorical features.
- Requires handling of missing values and categorical encoding.

## ‚ú® Features

- Data loading and initial inspection.
- Handling missing values through imputation or removal.
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., using LabelEncoder or one-hot encoding).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- Training and evaluating various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this notebook locally, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries. You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## üöÄ Approach

My approach to house price prediction involved the following steps:

- **Library Import**: Imported essential Python libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and machine learning (sklearn).
  
- **Data Loading**: Loaded the dataset (e.g., `train.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame.

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
  - Identified and handled missing values across various features.
  - Transformed categorical features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
  - Performed feature engineering where necessary to create more informative variables.
    
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzed the distribution of `SalePrice` and other key numerical features.
  - Explored relationships between features and the target variable using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
  
- **Model Training and Testing**:
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  - Trained multiple regression models, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor.

- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the trained models using regression metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess their predictive performance.

## üìâ Visualizations


## üìä Results and Insights

### Key Insights:
  - The analysis typically reveals that features like living area, overall quality, and garage size are strong predictors of house prices.
  - Handling missing data and categorical variables effectively is crucial for model performance.
  - Comparison of different regression models helps in identifying the most suitable algorithm for the dataset.
    
### Final Outcome:
  - This project successfully demonstrates a complete workflow for building a house price prediction model.
  - The chosen model provides a reasonable estimation of house prices, which can be further improved through advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning or ensemble methods.
